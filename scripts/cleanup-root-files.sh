## Root Level
- `client/` - Next.js frontend application
- `server/` - Python FastAPI backend application
- `packages/` - Shared utilities and types
- `agents/` - AI agent implementations
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `scripts/` - Project-wide scripts and utilities
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `logs/` - Application and test logs
- `temp/` - Temporary files and debug artifacts

## Documentation Organization
- `docs/progress-reports/` - Development progress reports and summaries
- `docs/archived/` - Archived documentation
- `docs/prd/` - Product requirements documentation
- `docs/architecture/` - System architecture documentation

## Configuration Organization
- `config/docker/` - Docker configuration files
- `config/testing/` - Testing configuration files
- `config/environments/` - Environment-specific configurations

## Scripts Organization
- `scripts/deployment/` - Deployment and environment setup scripts
- `scripts/legacy/` - Legacy organization and cleanup scripts
- `scripts/` - Current project scripts

## Logs Organization
- `logs/` - All application logs, test outputs, and debugging information

## Temporary Files
- `temp/` - Debug files, test artifacts, and temporary development files

## Guidelines for New Files
1. **Documentation**: Place in appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
2. **Configuration**: Place in appropriate `config/` subdirectory
3. **Scripts**: Place in appropriate `scripts/` subdirectory
4. **Logs**: Place in `logs/` directory
5. **Temporary files**: Place in `temp/` directory
6. **Never leave files at root level** unless they are essential project files (README, .gitignore, etc.)

# Root Files Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Completed: $(date)

### Files Organized
- **Documentation**: 13 files moved to \`docs/progress-reports/\`
- **Logs**: 3 files moved to \`logs/\`
- **Configuration**: 5 files moved to \`config/\` subdirectories
- **Scripts**: 7 files moved to \`scripts/\` subdirectories
- **Temporary**: 2 files moved to \`temp/\`

### Files Removed
- **System files**: 2 files removed (.DS_Store, .agent_pids)

### New Structure Created
- \`docs/progress-reports/\` - Development progress documentation
- \`logs/\` - Application and test logs
- \`config/docker/\` - Docker configurations
- \`config/testing/\` - Testing configurations
- \`scripts/deployment/\` - Deployment scripts
- \`scripts/legacy/\` - Legacy organization scripts
- \`temp/\` - Temporary and debug files

### Backup Location
All original files backed up to: \`$BACKUP_DIR\`

### Next Steps
1. Review the new organization
2. Update any hardcoded file paths in scripts
3. Update documentation references
4. Commit the new structure to version control

## Files Moved

### Documentation Files

### Log Files
$(ls -1 logs/ 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^/- /' || echo "- No files found")

### Configuration Files
$(find config/ -type f 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^/- /' || echo "- No files found")

### Script Files
