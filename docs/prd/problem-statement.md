# Problem Statement

Currently, the process of creating customized English language courses for corporate clients is heavily manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. This often involves bespoke curriculum design and content creation for each client, limiting the scalability and efficiency of Wall Street English Thailand's corporate training division. The lack of automation restricts the ability to rapidly respond to market demand, adapt to diverse client needs, or efficiently integrate client-specific technical language and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) into the curriculum.

## Key Problems

- **High operational costs** associated with manual course development
- **Limited scalability** for custom training solutions
- **Slower time-to-market** for new corporate training programs
- **Inconsistent quality** in customized course content due to manual processes
- **Reduced competitive advantage** in a dynamic corporate training market
