# Scope and Constraints

## Out of Scope (For Initial Version)

To maintain focus and deliver a robust MVP, the following functionalities are explicitly out of scope:

- **Direct Student-to-Student Communication:** No in-app messaging beyond structured peer review
- **Native Mobile Applications:** Responsive web applications only, no dedicated iOS/Android apps
- **Advanced Gamification Systems:** Basic gamification only (points, badges, basic leaderboards)
- **External LMS Integration:** Standalone platform operation, no third-party LMS integration
- **Real-time Video Conferencing:** Assumes use of external tools (Zoom, Teams) for live sessions
- **Automated Content Translation:** English-only content generation and SOP processing
- **Comprehensive CRM Integration:** Basic request submission only, no deep CRM integration

## Key Assumptions

- **LLM API Availability:** Consistent access to stable, cost-effective LLM APIs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- **SOP Parsability:** Client SOPs generally in parseable digital formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- **WSE Course Data Quality:** Existing 80-lesson course sufficiently structured for AI foundation
- **Client SOP Sharing:** Corporate clients willing to share confidential SOPs for customization
- **Trainer Adoption:** Trainers adaptable to AI-generated content and new portal tools
- **Infrastructure Scalability:** Cloud infrastructure can provide necessary compute and storage resources

## Constraints

- **Budget:** Development and operational costs within agreed-upon budget parameters
- **Timeline:** MVP delivery within target launch timeline
- **Technology Familiarity:** Initial choices influenced by organizational expertise for rapid development
- **Data Compliance:** Adherence to PDPA (Thailand), GDPR (international clients), and other relevant regulations
