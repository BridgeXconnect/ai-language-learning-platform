# Frontend Integration Progress

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Integration Plan**
   - Defined the BMAD method approach for integrating Next.js frontend with FastAPI backend
   - Outlined implementation phases and technical decisions

2. **Set Up API Service Layer**
   - Created API configuration with endpoints and constants
   - Implemented API service with error handling and token management
   - Added file upload utility with progress tracking
   - Created WebSocket service for real-time features

3. **Defined Types**
   - Created TypeScript interfaces for all data models
   - Defined enums for statuses and roles
   - Set up type-safe API interactions

4. **Authentication Integration**
   - Updated auth context to work with the backend JWT system
   - Implemented login form with form validation
   - Created middleware for route protection
   - Set up environment variables

5. **Development Setup**
   - Created script to start the Next.js frontend

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Authentication Flow**
   - Implement registration form
   - Add profile management
   - Test authentication flow end-to-end

2. **Sales Portal Integration**
   - Connect dashboard to backend API
   - Implement course request wizard
   - Add SOP file upload functionality
   - Connect data tables with pagination and filtering

3. **Course Manager Portal Integration**
   - Implement course generation wizard
   - Connect WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Build course management interfaces

4. **Trainer & Student Portal Integration**
   - Implement trainer dashboard
   - Build student learning interface
   - Connect progress tracking

5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Deployment configuration

## How to Run

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

2. Start the Next.js frontend:
   ```bash
   ./start-frontend-dev.sh
   ```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Technical Notes

- The integration follows the BMAD method principles:
  - **Brownfield**: Adapting to existing backend API contracts
  - **Modular**: Creating service layers and components that can be reused
  - **Agile**: Implementing features incrementally
  - **Design-first**: Using shadcn/ui components for consistent UI

- Authentication is handled via JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- API requests are centralized in the API service layer
- WebSocket connections are managed by a dedicated service
- Route protection is implemented via Next.js middleware
