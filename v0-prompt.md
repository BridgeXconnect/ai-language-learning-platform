## ðŸ”Œ Backend Integration Patterns

### API Configuration
```typescript
// Base configuration
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1'
const WS_URL = 'ws://localhost:8000/ws'

// Authentication headers
const authHeaders = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

### Key API Endpoints to Connect

#### Authentication
```typescript
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/register  
POST /auth/refresh
GET /auth/profile
```

#### Sales Endpoints
```typescript
GET /sales/course-requests
POST /sales/course-requests
PUT /sales/course-requests/{id}
POST /sales/course-requests/{id}/sop (file upload)
GET /sales/dashboard-stats
```

#### Course Management
```typescript
GET /courses/
POST /courses/
PUT /courses/{id}
GET /courses/{id}/modules
POST /ai/generate-course
GET /ai/generation-status/{id}
```

#### AI & Document Processing
```typescript
POST /ai/process-document
POST /ai/generate-content
GET /ai/indexed-sources
POST /ai/search-content
```

### WebSocket Integration
```typescript
// Real-time updates for course generation
const wsConnection = new WebSocket(`${WS_URL}/generation-updates`)
wsConnection.onmessage = (event) => {
  const update = JSON.parse(event.data)
  // Update progress bars, status indicators
}
```

## ðŸ“± Specific Component Requirements

### 1. Course Generation Wizard
```typescript
interface CourseGenerationWizard {
  steps: [
    'Upload SOPs',
    'Configure Parameters', 
    'Review & Generate',
    'Monitor Progress'
  ]
  features: [
    'Multi-file drag-drop upload',
    'CEFR level selection (A1-C2)',
    'Course duration settings',
    'Real-time generation progress',
    'Error handling & retry logic'
  ]
}
```

### 2. Interactive Dashboard Cards
```typescript
interface DashboardCard {
  variants: ['metric', 'chart', 'progress', 'activity']
  animations: 'smooth hover effects'
  responsive: true
  darkMode: 'supported'
}
```

### 3. Advanced Data Tables
```typescript
interface DataTable {
  features: [
    'Server-side pagination',
    'Column sorting',
    'Global search',
    'Row selection',
    'Export functionality',
    'Responsive stacking on mobile'
  ]
}
```

### 4. File Upload Components
```typescript
interface FileUpload {
  types: ['drag-drop', 'click-to-browse']
  formats: ['PDF', 'DOCX', 'TXT', 'XLSX']
  maxSize: '50MB'
  preview: 'show file details & processing status'

}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ State Management

Use React hooks and context for:
- Authentication state

  login: (credentials) => Promise<void>
  logout: () => void
  hasRole: (role: string) => boolean
}
```

## ðŸš¦ Error Handling & Loading States
