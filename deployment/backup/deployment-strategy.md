# Deployment Strategy

## Containerization
- **Docker containers** for all microservices and applications

## Orchestration
- **Kubernetes (AWS EKS)** for automated deployment, scaling, and management

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild** or GitHub Actions
- **Workflow:** Code commit → automated tests → Docker image build → Kubernetes deployment

## Deployment Environments
- **Development:** Active coding and feature development
- **Staging:** Pre-production environment for integration testing
- **Production:** Live environment serving end-users

## Deployment Patterns
- **Blue/Green Deployment** or **Canary Releases** for major updates
- **Rolling Updates** for minor changes
