## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. API Connectivity Problem ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Frontend couldn't connect to backend API  
**Root Cause**: Port mismatch (frontend expecting 8080, backend on 8001)  
**Resolution**:
- Updated `.env.local` API_BASE_URL from port 8080 to 8001
- Fixed CORS configuration to allow port 3000 frontend access
- Updated all environment configuration files for consistency

**Test Result**: ✅ Authentication and API calls now working perfectly

### 2. Database Relationship Issues ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: SQLAlchemy relationship errors preventing database initialization  
**Root Cause**: Missing User-Course relationship definitions  
**Resolution**:
- Added `created_courses` and `approved_courses` relationships to User model
- Fixed foreign key references in Course model
- Successfully initialized database with sample data

**Test Result**: ✅ Database fully functional with demo users and data

### 3. Environment Configuration Inconsistencies ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Mismatched port configurations across environment files  
**Resolution**:
- Standardized backend port to 8001 across all configs
- Updated frontend port references to 3000
- Synchronized CORS origins and API base URLs

**Test Result**: ✅ All services communicate properly
