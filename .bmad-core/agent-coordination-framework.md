# BMAD Multi-Agent Coordination Framework

## Overview
This document defines the coordination framework for the BMAD multi-agent parallel implementation system, enabling seamless collaboration between Architect, Product Owner, Developer, and QA agents.

## Agent Coordination Model

### Core Principles
1. **Parallel Execution**: Agents work simultaneously on different aspects
2. **Dependency Management**: Clear handoff points and blocking relationships
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Automated and manual conflict resolution mechanisms
4. **State Synchronization**: Real-time state sharing across agents
5. **Quality Gates**: Checkpoints ensuring work quality before progression

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

- Stakeholder feedback incorporation
- Next week planning and prioritization

### 3. Sprint Boundaries
**Schedule**: Every 2-3 weeks
**Participants**: All agents + stakeholders
**Purpose**: Major deliverable completion, retrospective, planning

**Agenda**:
- Sprint deliverable demonstration
- Quality metrics review
- Retrospective and improvement identification
- Next sprint planning and commitment

## Dependency Management

### Critical Path Dependencies
```
Product Owner → Architect → Developer → QA
     ↓              ↓           ↓        ↓
Requirements → Architecture → Code → Tests → Release
```

### Parallel Work Streams
- **Architect + Product Owner**: Requirements refinement and technical feasibility
- **Developer + QA**: Implementation and test automation
- **All Agents**: Documentation and knowledge sharing

### Blocker Resolution
1. **Immediate**: Agent-to-agent direct communication
2. **Daily**: Escalation to daily sync meeting
3. **Weekly**: Escalation to integration review
4. **Critical**: Emergency coordination session

## Communication Protocols

### 1. Asynchronous Communication
**Tools**: Shared documentation, version control, issue tracking
**Usage**: Non-blocking information sharing, status updates, deliverable sharing
**Response Time**: 4-8 hours during business hours

### 2. Synchronous Communication
**Tools**: Video calls, screen sharing, collaborative editing
**Usage**: Complex problem solving, design sessions, conflict resolution
**Response Time**: Immediate during scheduled sessions

### 3. State Broadcasting
**Tools**: Real-time dashboards, webhook notifications, status APIs
**Usage**: Continuous state awareness, automatic trigger events
**Response Time**: Real-time (<1 minute)

## Quality Gates

### 1. Design Quality Gate
**Trigger**: Architecture deliverable completion
**Participants**: Architect, Product Owner, Developer
**Criteria**: 
- Technical feasibility validated
- Business requirements satisfied
- Implementation path defined
- Resource requirements confirmed

### 2. Implementation Quality Gate
**Trigger**: Code deliverable completion
**Participants**: Developer, QA, Architect
**Criteria**:
- Code quality standards met
- Test coverage >90%
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- Security requirements satisfied

### 3. Release Quality Gate
**Trigger**: Testing completion
**Participants**: QA, Product Owner, Developer
**Criteria**:
- All tests passing
- User acceptance criteria met
- Performance validated
- Documentation complete

## Conflict Resolution

### 1. Technical Conflicts
**Scope**: Architecture, implementation, testing approaches
**Resolution Process**:
1. Agent-to-agent discussion
2. Technical review session
3. Architect final decision
4. Documentation of decision rationale

### 2. Requirements Conflicts
**Scope**: Business requirements, user experience, scope
**Resolution Process**:
1. Product Owner clarification
2. Stakeholder consultation
3. Business impact assessment
4. Product Owner final decision

### 3. Resource Conflicts
**Scope**: Timeline, capacity, priority
**Resolution Process**:
1. Workload assessment
2. Priority re-evaluation
3. Resource reallocation
4. Timeline adjustment

## Automation Framework

### 1. Automated Coordination
```yaml
triggers:
  - code_push: notify_qa_agent
  - architecture_update: notify_developer_agent
  - requirements_change: notify_all_agents
  - quality_gate_failure: escalate_to_coordinator

workflows:
  - daily_sync: automated_status_collection
  - integration_test: automated_validation
  - deployment: automated_coordination
```

### 2. Notification System
- **Slack/Teams Integration**: Real-time updates
- **Email Notifications**: Formal milestone communications
- **Dashboard Updates**: Visual status representations
- **API Webhooks**: System-to-system notifications
