# BMAD Task: Archon Agent Integration Automation

## Epic: Transform AI Language Learning Platform to Multi-Agent System

### Task Overview
- **Task ID**: BMAD-ARCH-001
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 hours
- **Dependencies**: Existing AI services, Docker setup, Supabase configuration

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Archon repository cloned and configured
- [ ] Agent orchestrator service created
- [ ] Course planning agent generated and deployed
- [ ] Content creation agent generated and deployed
- [ ] Quality assurance agent generated and deployed
- [ ] Docker compose updated with agent services
- [ ] API gateway routes updated
- [ ] MCP integration configured
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline established
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Automation Steps (Claude Code + MCP)

#### Phase 1: Repository Setup
- [ ] Clone Archon repository via Browserbase MCP
- [ ] Set up local development environment
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test Archon installation

#### Phase 2: Agent Generation
- [ ] Generate Course Planning Agent using Archon
- [ ] Generate Content Creation Agent using Archon
- [ ] Generate Quality Assurance Agent using Archon
- [ ] Generate Agent Orchestrator service

#### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Create agent service directories
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Modify FastAPI routes for agent communication
- [ ] Set up MCP connections between agents

#### Phase 4: Deployment
- [ ] Build and test agent containers

- [ ] Configure logging and metrics
- [ ] Create dashboards
- [ ] Set up alerts

### Rollback Plan
- [ ] Keep existing AI services as fallback
- [ ] Feature flag for agent vs traditional flow
- [ ] Database rollback scripts prepared
- [ ] Container rollback procedures documented

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All agent services running healthy
- [ ] Course generation time improved by 40%
- [ ] Agent collaboration working correctly
- [ ] Zero downtime deployment achieved
- [ ] API response times maintained < 2s

### Notes
- Use Browserbase MCP for GitHub operations
- Claude Code for all code generation and modification
- BMAD methodology for task tracking and validation
